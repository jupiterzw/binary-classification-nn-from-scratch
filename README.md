# binary-classification-nn-from-scratch

This is a basic deep neural network developed from scratch for a better grasp of neural network mechanics. It's applied to image classification for cat and non-cat images.

The L-layer Model currently yields low accuracy at 34%. This may stem from issues in the `linear_activation_backward()` function or suboptimal hyperparameters. I'm working on resolving this. My apologies. 

In contrast, the 2-layer Model achieves a higher accuracy of around 72%.
